  body: '\u003cp\u003eWhen your business involves analyzing statistical data from different sources, you need to know how to collect, store, index, transform it into other data, analyze it, and so on.\u003cbr /\u003e\r\nQuite often the project scale is not yet large enough to implement large software platforms, and in this case, universal options based on standard SQL or NoSQL solutions will help you cope with the accumulation and processing of medium-sized data.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSuch solutions, based on our practice, include Elasticsearch, which we will discuss in this article.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Elasticsearch and what is it for?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#39;s start with a brief description of \u003ca href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/" target="_blank"\u003eElasticsearch\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning-fast search, relevancy, and analytics that scale with ease. It actually lets you perform and combine many types of searches \u0026mdash; structured, unstructured, geo, metric, etc.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eElasticsearch is a fast, horizontally scalable, and very free hybrid of NoSQL database and Google. It communicates with the world via the HTTP API and receives JSON documents for indexing and storage. Storage, however, can be disabled, and in that case, there will only be a search engine that returns the IDs of once indexed documents.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Elasticsearch is successfully used by eBay, Adobe, Uber, Nvidia, Blizzard, Volkswagen, SoundCloud, GitHub, Netflix, and Amazon. What is the appeal of Elasticsearch? Let\u0026#39;s get this straight.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the main values in working with it is a well-organized \u003ca href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/features#full-text-search--inverted-index-" target="_blank"\u003efull-text search\u003c/a\u003e. In fact, this is a quick search across the entire text, across the entire text\u0026#39;s database.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eListing the main features of this service, they clearly include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cul class="dotted"\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eAn open-source search server is written in Java\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eIndexing any heterogeneous data\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eREST API web interface with JSON output\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eText search\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eReal-time search (NRT)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eDistributed document storage without schemas, REST, and\u0026nbsp;JSON\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eSupport for multiple languages and geo-location\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="bookmark" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\u003ca href="https://yellow.systems/blog/phytoneering-extract-solutions-how-we-made-nature-digital" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003ePhytoneering Extract Solutions \u0026ndash; How We Made Nature Digital\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf a project or organization is working with a large amount of data and documents, related and unrelated, and this company wants the search to be as useful and productive as possible, then Elasticsearch is the best solution.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat advantages can it add to the project?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, everything is learned with comparisons, so if you compare Elasticsearch with similar systems, you come to the conclusion that Elasticsearch has one of the fastest implementations of end-to-end search.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that the functionality of Elasticsearch also consists of storage for the necessary data. In terms of data storage, SQL and NoSQL databases have some advantages over Elasticsearch. And relying on this service as a database for storing data is a common mistake. You need to understand that this is primarily a database for fast and high-quality data search, and not for storing them.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf we are talking about the advantages of using Elasticsearch, then among them will be those such as:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cul class="dotted"\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eYou can \u003ca href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/features#document-store--unstructured-" target="_blank"\u003estore\u003c/a\u003e data without a schema, and create a schema for your data.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eManage your data records using multi-document APIs.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eFilter and query your data to provide a better understanding.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eBased on Apache Lucene and provides a \u003ca href="https://yellow.systems/blog/good-restful-api-and-how-we-make-it" target="_blank"\u003eRESTful API\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eProvides horizontal scalability, reliability, and multi-user capabilities for real-time indexing.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe ability to scale both vertically and horizontally.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat projects have we used it on\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur team has several good examples of successful work with Elasticsearch, which only confirms the opinion that this service is ideal when the task is to quickly search through a huge amount of data.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, in the case of a project for a law firm that needed to set up a search for a library of various precedents dating back to 1870. This is, in fact, a huge repository of data from all the courts that existed then and now, containing all the cases that occurred over more than 100 years. Initially, when this project was developed, Elasticsearch had not been developed, but at the stage of refactoring, in which we were able to participate, the productivity and quality of search that we managed to achieve with this service increased significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="bookmark" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\u003ca href="https://yellow.systems/blog/how-to-be-a-good-customer" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003eHow to Be a Good Client\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, in one of our current projects, this work is also being done using Elasticsearch. The amount of data is not so large in comparison with the previous case, approximately 10,000\u0026nbsp;pages of text. However, the use of Elasticsearch on this project was due to the fact that the project is associated with active communication and blogging, and the amount of data is growing exponentially. This exponential growth is guaranteed to lead to the fact that after some time the amount of data that will require searching will increase significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut even at this stage, the use of cached queries to the database, in comparison with what Elasticsearch allowed to do, differs significantly in the time when search results are received. And there is every reason to think that as the amount of data on this project increases, this difference will only grow. At this stage, the project is migrating from a relational database to Elasticsearch, and we are already seeing an excellent performance increase in search queries within this project.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eTo sum it up\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the amount of data on a particular project, the client always wants to find information as quickly as possible. In this case, those who work on the project have the task of making such a quick search possible.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the many solutions out there, you need to choose from the best ones. Elasticsearch has earned its place on that list because no matter how quickly the amount of information grows, this service will definitely handle it!\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="link-to-contact-screen" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;ve got any questions, just contact us and we\u0026#39;ll be right there for you\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ca href="/contact" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003eYour friends at Yellow\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n',

It is responsible for receiving user data, such as messages and files, storing them locally, transferring to the backend for further processing, and displaying them to users. In other words, the Chat App acts as a mediator between the user and the backend.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eUsers interact with the Chat App via the Chat User Interface (Chat UI). It includes various components and widgets that are used to send text and voice messages, share files, display dialogs, contact lists, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eChat Server Engine\u003c/strong\u003e is a pool of external servers responsible for the chat performance. The Chat Server Engine does all of the dirty work that is not visible to the users: obtains user messages from the Chat App, processes them, and delivers to the recipient. The Chat Server Engine falls into several components, each of them having their own responsibility: user files storage, message processing and delivery, etc. We\u0026rsquo;ll be covering all of them a bit later in this\u0026nbsp;article.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a general view of the chat architecture:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eclient\u0026nbsp;\u0026lt;---\u0026gt;\u0026nbsp;chat engine \u0026lt;---\u0026gt; client\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo get deeper into the chat architecture, let\u0026rsquo;s send our cat out on an adventure.

Preparations\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo make sure that the cat is not captured by some other cat lovers along the way, it gets encrypted with a security key so that no one but the recipient can decrypt it. Furthermore, the encrypted cat is transferred to the Chat Media Storage\u0026mdash;a server where static data, such as user files, are stored (Amazon S3, Cloudinary, etc). The cat gets there via the Chat Media Storage Client\u0026mdash;a Chat Client Engine component responsible for uploading data on the Chat Media Storage.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Chat message queue\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/290/content_4-2.png\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the cat finds itself a cozy place in the Media Storage, a link to where it is located\u0026nbsp;is generated to be further sent to the recipient.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSPOILER: You might have noticed that when you get a message with a picture attached, the picture sometimes has a\u0026nbsp;Download indicator in the middle (like in Telegram and Viber) and is blurred (like in WhatsApp).\u0026nbsp;That\u0026rsquo;s because you didn\u0026#39;t receive the picture itself but rather the message with the link to it inside. To be viewed, the picture has to be downloaded from the \u003cstrong\u003eChat Media Storage Client\u003c/strong\u003e and decrypted first.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eStep 2.

The message is transferred to the \u003cstrong\u003eChat Device Storage\u003c/strong\u003e, which is, actually, a user\u0026rsquo;s device storage where all messages are located. It allows users to access them anytime even if there is no Internet connection.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the message gets dispatched to the Chat Server Engine via the \u003cstrong\u003eChat WebSocket Client\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the message reaches the Chat Server Engine, you can see the\u0026nbsp;first check mark appear in your message.

The messages are handled by \u003cstrong\u003eChat Workers\u003c/strong\u003e, which are the server threads that take messages from the Queue and try to deliver them to the right recipients.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"How chat works\" class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/292/content_6-2.png\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the worker takes the message from the Queue, two scenarios are possible.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eScenario 1. The recipient is offline\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf the recipient is offline, the message can\u0026rsquo;t be delivered immediately. In this case, the message just stays in the Queue until the user goes online.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eScenario 2. The recipient is online\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf the recipient is online, the message is delivered through the \u003cstrong\u003eChat WebSocket \u003c/strong\u003eor \u003cstrong\u003eVOIP Push message\u003c/strong\u003e and removed from the Queue. Then, the message gets decrypted and goes to the internal data storage on the recipient\u0026rsquo;s device. At the time, the second check mark appears in the message, notifying that the message has been successfully delivered\u0026mdash;but not yet read.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, a notification pops up on your friend\u0026#39;s device, stating that there is an unread message. As soon as your friend\u0026nbsp;opens the Chat App, the message stored in the Chat Device Storage is displayed in the Chat UI. At once, both check marks on your device change\u0026nbsp;color, thereby notifying that the message has been read.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eVoila!

  title: 'How to Create a Wireframe for Your Mobile App?',
  body: '\u003cp\u003eIn our prototype-or-die world, a wireframe for apps is a kind of a stepson, whose role in the design process sometimes remains ambiguous even to the fellow design squad. Let alone the purpose, even its look often leaves clients asking questions.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cimg alt="wireframe" class="img-responsive" src="//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/161/content_wireframe2.png" /\u003e\r\n\u003cp class="description" style="text-align: center;"\u003eA typical wireframe\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is Wireframing?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eNot a rough sketch drawn hastily on a piece of a napkin (inspiration never waits for the right time to come), not yet a full-fledged prototype. Plain, gray-colored, with Lorem Ipsum instead of text and crossed rectangles instead of images, just a simple template of an idea created from scratch \u0026hellip; No wonder the value of a wireframe is not so self-evident. Neither is it clear how much time and expertise building a wireframe actually requires.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe at Yellow never skip the stage of wireframing when we start a new project. As true advocates of wireframes, we believe that they do and will remain a powerful and efficient tool for refining concepts, experimenting, testing and gathering user feedback at the earliest stage of product development. You\u0026rsquo;ll have the chance to see it for yourself in the coming chapters of this article.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, our clients are usually not so enthusiastic about wireframes as we are.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cimg alt="typical dialogue with a client" class="img-responsive" src="//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/156/content_chat_01.png" /\u003e\r\n\u003cp class="description" style="text-align: center;"\u003eThis is what discussing a wireframe with a client is often like.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBasic\u003c/strong\u003e is a very proper word for a wireframe, although many would probably use it with a negative connotation, as in the case above. Actually, the dialog above uncovers the major reason why wireframes are so underestimated; it\u0026rsquo;s the absence of \u0026ldquo;decorations.\u0026rdquo; It turns out that app design wireframe, for example, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the whole \u0026lsquo;design\u0026rsquo; party, and that makes people think that the stage of wireframing is optional in the development cycle and can be safely skipped for the sake of saving time and money.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, wireframes are not about beauty. Their primary purpose is to show what underlies good design and animation: \u003cstrong\u003efunctionality, information architecture, user flow, and navigation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOne may think of a wireframe as of a backbone. Just as the backbone holds together muscles and tendons, giving a human\u0026rsquo;s body strength and structure, a wireframe outlines the app\u0026rsquo;s interface, focusing on how it will function rather than on how it will look. That\u0026rsquo;s the reason why wireframes are so basic: unnecessary beautification only distracts attention from the essential components.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eStemming from the argument above is a typical question clients often ask us. Why is creating a wireframe so difficult then? Why does this \u0026ldquo;basic thing\u0026rdquo; require so much time and effort, and\u0026mdash;what is even stranger\u0026mdash;the whole group\u0026nbsp;of professionals?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is as simple as the creation of a mobile app wireframe.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo create a wireframe is to create a product.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSure, there\u0026rsquo;ll still be a lot of engineering ahead, but given proper rigor, the skyscraper is usually not much worse than the blueprint. That\u0026rsquo;s why it takes a truly holistic approach to make a wireframe for an app, web page or software\u0026mdash;the one that requires understanding business, technology, marketing, user experience, and what\u0026rsquo;s the hardest\u0026mdash;everything in between.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="bookmark" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\u003ca href="https://yellow.systems/blog/software-product-design-what-do-the-best-apps-have-in-common" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003eWhy wireframing and designing a product are two completely different processes? \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Does It Really Take to Create a Wireframe for Mobile App?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Understanding the audience\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest mistake most clients are prone to is associating their own needs with the ones of their users. No doubt, there is a huge temptation to think that all people look at the world through the same lens. However, it\u0026rsquo;s a sure way to fall into a trap of empty assumptions.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo eliminate guesswork from the development process, we encourage our clients to get to know their users better and figure out if the future product is what they really need. Wireframing helps a lot with the task as it has proved itself to be one of the greatest tools for testing assumptions.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eShowing wireframes to potential users for review and comments is the easiest and quickest way to validate a product concept. From the way users interact with the product wireframes, it becomes clear if the app-to-be is going to spark interest among the target audience, or if it\u0026rsquo;s able to deal with the user problem in a manner.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, wireframes can be further used as an unflagging source of usability insights. As users don\u0026rsquo;t get distracted by their design, they focus on the layout, functionality, and navigation in terms of convenience and ease of use, providing the engineering team with detailed feedback on the future app\u0026rsquo;s usability. During further iterations, the testing\u0026ndash;getting feedback\u0026ndash;refining cycle is repeated up to the moment when the users\u0026rsquo; pains are fully covered.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s the algorithm we proved when brainstorming ideas for our own product. Therefore, here is an example of how wireframe app development can save the day.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="link-to-contact-screen" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe can brainstorm and find that very idea for your product as well\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ca href="/contact" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003eContact us\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eYellow\u0026rsquo;s case study: \u003ca href="https://stickerbox.link"\u003eStickerbox\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we just started working out the concept of Stickerbox, we weren\u0026rsquo;t sure long enough what the app should be. It took us several wireframing iterations to find ourselves on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur first assumption was that users would like to make fully customized stickers out of their photos. That\u0026rsquo;s why the earlier versions of Stickerbox included the functions needed to tweak every little detail.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as we further tested the app wireframe with the real users, it turned out that they didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend their time staring at the screens of their phones and trying to make the\u0026nbsp;\u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; decision; they were fine with the options offered by the app. Since we discovered that, Stickerbox as we know it now has been officially born.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cimg alt="sticker box interface before and after" class="img-responsive" src="//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/157/content_stickerbox.jpg" /\u003e\r\n\u003cp class="description" style="text-align: center;"\u003eScreenshot of a Stickerbox interface: before and after\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Understanding the market\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with studying users, wireframing an app also requires thorough market research. Sometimes, in an aspiration to bring the product to life asap, clients tend to ignore the real needs of the market, while wireframing encourages to constantly keep an eye on them.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile validating ideas for future projects (software, websites, apps \u0026ndash; whatever), you\u0026rsquo;ll inevitably have to keep up with the market trends while also asking yourself a bunch of critical questions. Has the problem ever been tackled before? Was it successful? If no, why? If yes, are there still issues uncovered? And the most important one\u0026mdash;if the problem hasn\u0026rsquo;t been tackled, does the market for a future product truly exist?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFinding answers to the above questions allows identifying if there is a market niche for the future project. And if it turns out no, pivoting towards an unoccupied niche at the wireframing stage is a no-brainer compared to the major upheavals that may follow at the later stages of the development cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Experimenting\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFinding the right concept for the product always takes time and effort, and the first idea coming to mind is not always the best one. Besides, the market is flexible and changing all the time. \u0026nbsp; That\u0026rsquo;s why we should always be ready to experiment\u0026mdash;read: admit that our assumptions are wrong and act accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eA wireframing stage is perfect for experimenting as it imposes no restrictions on the team. As we mentioned in the previous chapter, testing, refining and rejecting concepts at the wireframing stage costs literally nothing compared to the cost of making even minor changes to the functionality during the engineering phase. Therefore you can try any ideas that come to your mind until the right one is found.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Simplifying\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden rule we encourage our clients to stick to is \u0026ldquo;one app\u0026mdash;one key feature.\u0026rdquo; Adding more features to the app after its core functionality has been defined sometimes makes the app worse. Sounds like a paradox, but good products are often so good because they DON\u0026rsquo;T include many things.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWireframes help keep this argument in mind. How to wireframe an app which has a list of \u0026ldquo;the main features\u0026rdquo; that is larger than Santa\u0026rsquo;s list of both nice and naughty children? The austere design of wireframes encourages the accurate prioritization of the app features and content. It helps to concentrate on essential things first and, as a result, avoids overloading the app with redundant functionality.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003e5. Managing budget\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile wireframing itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t require massive money injections, it\u0026rsquo;s literally the best investment at the project start. First and foremost, it helps outline further development stages as it allows to estimate how much money and time each stage will take, and what technology and design kit will be required throughout the development cycle. At the same time, in case you have to deal with strictly fixed funds, it helps fit the future app into the existing budget by means of well-calculated trade-offs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="link-to-contact-screen" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWith our extensive web development experience we\u0026#39;ll help you with all this and so much more\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ca href="/contact" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003eGet in touch\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat kind of team is required to create a wireframe?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWireframing indeed requires thoughtful teamwork, which can\u0026rsquo;t be simply boiled down to a designer\u0026rsquo;s responsibility.

  title: 'REST Security Basics',
  body: '\u003cp\u003eREST is a modern architectural style that defines a new approach to designing web services. Unlike its predecessors, HTTP and SOA, it\u0026rsquo;s not a protocol (read: a strict set of rules), but rather a number of recommendations and best practices of how web services should communicate to each other. The services that are developed in compliance with the best REST practices are called \u0026ldquo;RESTful web services.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity is a cornerstone of RESTful web services. One of the ways to enable it is a proper in-built user authentication and authorization mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are lots of ways to implement user authentication and authorization within the RESTful web services. The main approaches (or standards) we are going to talk about today are the following:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cul class="dotted"\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eBasic authentication\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eOAuth 2.0\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\t\u003cli\u003eOAuth 2.0 + JWT\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo make our discussion more specific, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that we have microservices on the backend of our application, and upon each user request, several services at the backend have to be called to collect the requested data. Thus, we will examine each standard not only in terms of security issues, but also in the context of additional traffic and server load they generate. Here we go...\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv class="bookmark" style="margin: 50px 0;"\u003e\u003ca href="https://yellow.systems/blog/load-testing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"\u003eWhy you should never neglect load testing in your projects and when it\u0026rsquo;s the best time to embark on it\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eBasic authentication\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe oldest and the simplest standard on the list.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it looks:\u003c/strong\u003e username + password + Base64 (a basic algorithm of hashing usernames and passwords).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e Imagine that a user tries to log into their Facebook account to access feed, messages, friends, and groups, which are all separate services. After the user inserts their username and password, the system knows they are allowed to enter and lets them in. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know by default what are their roles and privileges, what services they are allowed to access, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo every time the user tries to access any service, the system should once again verify if they are allowed to do this, which implies an additional call to the authentication server. As far as there are four services in our example, there will be four additional calls per user in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eNow imagine that we have 3K user requests per second, though in case of Facebook 300K sounds more realistic. Multiplying them by four services, we will end up with 12K calls to the authentication server per second.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt="baseline architecture" class="img-responsive" src="//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/263/content_1._Baseline_architecture_1-2.jpg" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e: bad scalability, a huge amount of additional traffic that does not bring business value, significant load on the server.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eOAuth 2.0\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it looks:\u003c/strong\u003e username + password + access token + expiration token\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e The main idea of the OAuth 2.0 standard is that after a user logs into the system with their username and password, a client (a device the person uses to access the system) receives a pair of tokens, which are an access token and a refresh token.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe access token is used to access all services in the system. After it expires, the system uses the refresh token to generate a new pair of tokens. So, if a user enters the system every day, the tokens will also be updated every day, and there will be no need to log into the system with username and password every time. The refresh token also has its expiration period (though it\u0026rsquo;s much longer than the one of the access token), and if a user hasn\u0026rsquo;t entered the system for\u0026mdash;let\u0026rsquo;s say\u0026mdash;a year, they are likely to be asked to insert the username and password again.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe OAuth 2.0 standard came to replace the basic authentication approach, and it has certain advantages, such as that a user doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to insert username and password every time they want to enter the system. However, the system still needs to make calls to the auth server, as in the case with the basic auth approach, to check what what the user who owns the token is authorized to do.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the expiration date is one day. That implies significantly less load on the login server, because a user has to insert their credentials only once a day, not every time they want to enter the system. However, the system still needs to verify each token and to check out the user roles\u0026nbsp;as well as store state somewhere. So, we again end up with multiple calls to the authentication server.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt="password grant" class="img-responsive" src="//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/264/content_2._OAuth2-Password_Grant_2-2.jpg" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e same issues as with the basic authentication approach \u0026mdash; bad scalability and a huge load on the authentication server.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eOAuth 2 + JSON\u0026nbsp;Web Tokens\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it looks:\u003c/strong\u003e username + password + JSON map + Base64 + private key + expiration date\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e When a user logs into the system with their username and password for the first time, the system returns back not just an access token, which is simply a string, but a JSON map containing all user information, such as roles and privileges, encoded with Base64 and signed with a private key. This is how it looks with and\u0026nbsp;without encoding:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt="rest security basics" class="img-responsive" src="//s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/yellow.studio/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/265/content_4._encodedvs.decoded_4-2.jpg" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eLooks scary, but this actually works! The main difference is that we can store state in the token, while services stay stateless. This\u0026nbsp;means that the users themselves hold their own info and there is no need for\u0026nbsp;additional calls to retrieve it as everything is already inside the token. And this\u0026nbsp;is\u0026nbsp;a huge deal in reducing the load on the server.

Amazon is one of the big players currently using it.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe main point is that when you create an Amazon account, they generate a permanent and super secret access token, which you should store very carefully and never show to anyone. When you need to request some info from Amazon, you take all http headers, sign them with this private token, and send this string as an additional header.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOn the server side, Amazon also has your super private access key. What they do next? They simply take your http headers and sign them with this key. Then, they just compare this string with what you\u0026rsquo;ve sent as a signature string; if they are identical, then you are really who you said you are.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe great benefit is that you have to send your username and password only once\u0026mdash;to receive the token. As for the headers signed with the private key, there is literally no chance to encode them.
