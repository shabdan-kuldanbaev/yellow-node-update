                Users struggled to find the information they needed and thus had to create ticket requests.
                It’s vital for support teams to address those tickets as soon as possible,
                but the influx of tickets overloaded the team and they began to fall behind.
                This is what formed our goals, which were twofold. First, we needed to increase the “self-service” score.
                Second, we needed to design a fresh, Turo-branded look for the support portal.`,

                  Its purpose is to inform users passively and to assist directly when they face issues that cannot be solved alone.
                  To do this effectively support messaging should be empathetic.
                  The support portal itself should also have a welcoming and friendly vibe.
                  To evoke such feelings, brands should maintain consistency across their styles.
                  When customers see a brand, they should be able to immediately recognize and remember them.
                  This helps to build trust. During the redesign, we extended Turo's brand language across
                  all of their design components to help achieve easy recognition.`,
